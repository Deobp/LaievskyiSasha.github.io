 Variable can have in name only letters,digits and symbols(underscore `_` and dollar sign `$`). But first character must be a letter or symbols(`_`,`$`). 
 Variables cannot have same name with reserved name like `function` or for example `return`.

Examples with valid names:
{% highlight javascript %}
let num;
var $user;
const _sum213;
{% endhighlight %}

And examples with no valid names:
{% highlight javascript %}
let %num;
let function;
let 12sum;
{% endhighlight %}

Variable names case sensitive. `let sum` and `let sUM` - two difference variable.
